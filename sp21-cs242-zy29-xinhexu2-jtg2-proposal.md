 * Name: Xinhe Xu(xinhexu2), Zhenzhou Yang(zy29) | Moderator: Jack Gentile (jtg2)

# Abstract
* Project Motivation:
  * Since there is one PhD student at Chicago that has been shot and lost his life. We want to create an App that everyone can check if the places they are visiting are safe enough from their mobile phones.
* Project Purpose:
  * The App can show the crime information, the potential risk of the area. Also can search for specific area and point out some dangerous areas. 

# Technical Specification:

  * Programming Language:Python, JavaScript, HTML
  * IDE: Visual Studio Code/Pycharm/Android Studio
  * Tools/Interface: React Native, React Navigation, Android emulator (Android Studio)
  * Style conventions: JavaScript Style Guide
  * platform: cross-platform app


# Functional Specification:
  
  * Main Page:
    1. Splitting the city into several sections and for each section we will show the number of crimes happened in this area on the map
    2. Use the different color to show the areaâ€™s potential risk
  * Crime data list page:
    1. Show all the Crime data as a list just including the name and location and date.
    2. Can use a range of date to search the crime data
    3. We can change the location in Crime data page
    4. Tap on the specified crime can show its concrete information
    5. Click on the specific data, it can go to the crime information page
    6. Show the highlight of the crime which has not been resolved
  * Crime Information Page:
    1. It can show the details of specific crime data.
    2. Show the highlight of the crime which has not been resolved
  * Visualization page:
    1. Show the Crime risk rank
    2. Show the number of crime in Chicago area
    3. Show the each type of crime number
